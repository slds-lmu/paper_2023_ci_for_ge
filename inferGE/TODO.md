# TODO

* [ ] Ensure that the results of the `infer_<method>()` functions also make sense when n is not divisible by k.
* [ ] Add the possibility to create one-sided CIs (?)
* [ ] Smarter documentation of parameters for the `infer_<method>` functions.
* [ ] Proper naming of inference methods: 
   Currently we name some by the author and others by the method. This is bad.
