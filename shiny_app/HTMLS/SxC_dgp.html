The plots show the coverage error (rmse) of a single selected DGP (y) for different dataset sizes (x).<br>
This root-mean-square error to the nominal level is calculated over all inducers and inference methods, unless they are selected as either "Group" or "Color".<br>
Methods that produce far too wide intervals (have an empirical coverage of around 100%) might be overlooked, see the "Width vs. Coverage Error" tab to get a better idea.<br>

If there is only one size, the selected "Color" variable becomes the y axis.
