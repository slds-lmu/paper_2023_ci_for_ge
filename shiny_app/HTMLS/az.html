Besides the main benchmark study, we conducted a separate experiment that compared the variance estimator from the ROCV inference method (Austern and Zhou) with the true variance of the CV point estimate.
We used a linear regression model on datasets simulated from a distribution following the relationship below:

$$Y_i = X_i + E_i, \quad \text{where } i = 1, \ldots, n, \quad X_i \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0, 1), \quad E_i \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0, 0.04)$$
The experiment was repeated for different choices of $$n \in \{500, 1000, 5000, 10000\}$$.
To estimate the true variance of the (5-fold) cross-validation, we obtained 100 cross-validation point estimates on independently simulated datasets.
The variance estimator for the ROCV method was repeated 10 times.
The plot below shows that the ratio of the estimated standard deviation to the true standard deviation of the cross-validation point estimate is close to sqrt(2), thereby empirically supporting our theoretical argument.
