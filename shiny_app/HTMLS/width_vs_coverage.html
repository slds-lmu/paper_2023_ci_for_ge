Here, we see

 <ul>
  <li>
  <b>x-axis</b>: The average with of a CI method, relative to Bayle (10-fold CV, all-pairs estimator).<br>
   </li>
  <li><b>y-axis</b>: The root-mean-square coverage error from the nominal level (0.95) </li>
</ul> 
Both are calculated over all <i>selected</i> inducers or DGP, unless they are specified as the grouping variable.<br>
The best methods are in the lower-left corner, i.e. they have low coverage error and a small width.

When selecting size = 100, either disable the linear / logistic model or the datasets with high p in which those models are unidentifiable and sometimes lead to strange CIs.
