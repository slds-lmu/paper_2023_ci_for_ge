## TODO

* [ ] For the implementation we need to ensure that we properly deal with the case where n is not divisible by k. 
  In the main papers they usually assume that for simplicity.
  We can either ensure that this is actually the case, but if the methods should be merged into mlr3, then we should 
  properly address this scenario.

* [ ] Look at the Bayle experiment code: How did they calculate the (approximate) true test error?
   https://github.com/alexandre-bayle/cvci.



For the mixed models:

* Look at the size of the effect of the mixed model. What should be the interpretation of the grouping effect???
