These are real-world datasets from which covariance matrices are estimated, that are then used to simulate data from a multivariate normal distribution.
This is analogous to the approach in [Evaluation of avariable selection methods for random forests and omics data sets](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbx124).
