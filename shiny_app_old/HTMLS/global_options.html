<b>Important</b>: The selections that are made here apply to all plots on the website.<br><br>
It is possible to select a subsets for the data-generating processes (DGPs) and for the inference methods.<br>
By default, we only show a subset for both in the interest of readability:

<ul>
  <li>
   <i>DGP</i>: By default, we don't include the results for <i>chen_10_null</i> (no relatonship between the features
      and target), as all methods perform poor for this dataset. See the <i>Chen 10 Null</i> tab for a separate analysis.
  <li> <i>Inference Methods</i>: By default, we omit the
    <ul>
      <li> out-of-bag and 632+ bootstrap methods for 10, 50, and 100 repetitions, as the CIs are generally far too wide, and the results for 500 repetitions are omitted as they are relatively similar to those with 1000 repetitions, 
      <li> corrected-t method with 50 repetitions (we include the results for 10, 100 repetitions),
      <li> bayle method with the within-fold variance estimator, as the results are very similar to the all-pairs variance estimator,
      <li> location shifted bootstrap with 50 repetitions, but we do include the results with 100 repetitions.
 </ul>
