  <li> The plots here compare the inference methods, aggregated over everything except for the size and what is selected as "Color".
  <li> If there is only one size, the selected "Color" variable becomes the y axis and a point-plot instead of a line-plot is shown.

  <li> To switch between Average Coverage Error and RMSE coverage error, change the selection for "Evaluation".
