<b>DGPs</b>: The table gives an overview of the different datasets that were used for the benchmark study.<br><br>

<b>Inference Methods</b>: This table gives an overview of the compared inference methods and their parameter settings, as well as the name with which they are referred to in the visualizations.<br>
Note that inference methods from the <i>tiny</i> category are only applied to datasets of size 100, those from the <i>small</i> category to size 100 and 500, and the methods from the <i>all</i> category to datasets of size 100, 500, 1000, 5000, and 10000.<br><br>

<b>Inducers</b>: This table gives an overview of the inducers and a brief description of their hyperparameters.<br><br>

<b>Loss Functions</b>: A brief overview of the four loss functions for regression and the three loss functions for classification that were used.<br><br>

<b>Results</b>: The aggregated results. Each inference method is applied 500 times to a given combination of (DGP, n, inducer), but we only show the aggregated coverage and width, and other results<br>
Here, <i>Cov. R</i>, <i>Cov. ER</i>, and <i>Cov. PQ</i> denotes the coverage frequency of the Risk, Expected Risk, and Proxy Quantity respectively.
