  <li> The plots here visualize the results for a single inducer, aggregated over everything except for the size and what is selected as "Color" or "Group".
  <li> If there is only one size, the selected "Color" variable becomes the y axis and a point-plot instead of a line-plot is shown.
  <li> To see the results for bccv, set the min size and max size to 100.
  <li> To switch between Coverage Frequency and RMSE coverage error, change the selection for "Evaluation".
